#APM Plus Hack#

We have made a hack of APM(ArduPilot Mega). We integrate an OSD module with the APM board called APM+ which removes the necessity of external OSD module like miniosd. 
we also did a extend OSD board which can be hot plug to the APM2.X board. It can used the origin firmware or firmware with OSD(remove some not common used features ).
